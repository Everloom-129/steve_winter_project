# steve_winter_project
My recent work at CVNext lab, supervised by Prof. Gaoang Wang, led by Mr. Zhonghan Zhao and Mr. Reself Chai.

I am keen and available to dedicate my time to STEVE in the upcoming winter. 
We are destinating at the ECCV 2024.

## My initial thinking on the task track 
a.	For lifelong learning, I am considering a text encoding method to let the bot do complex work like building a gate of hell, which requires long time exploitation on the world.  
b.	For Complex tasks, I heard you plan to let it build houses. As a fan of architecture previously, I think we can let the bot build a town based on the environment. For instance, the dessert town should be different from grassland town in architecture style. This job involves vision perception and common sense thinking, which is just the strength of LLMs.  
c.	Another Complex task is to kill the dragon. There is already some practice on this target, but none of them are robust and 'human-like' method. https://manifold.markets/AdamK/will-an-ai-minecraft-agent-defeat-t Maybe we can split it into a series of small tasks, training STEVE separately and let it kill the dragon finally. (Seems pretty hard, though)
